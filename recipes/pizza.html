    <h3>Steps to Make Pizza</h3>

        <li>Transfer the dough to a floured pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Brush the surface with olive oil to prevent sogginess.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin, even layer of tomato sauce over the dough.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the sauce, then add your preferred toppings.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven (or pizza stone) and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and cheese is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil or arugula if desired, then slice and serve hot.</li>
